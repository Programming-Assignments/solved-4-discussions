T<strong>opic 1:</strong> Health Informatics, Theoretical Foundations, and Practice Evolution

Discuss how health informatics evolved from being a concept to becoming a discipline or specialty. Emphasize the importance of the formation of professional organizations and educational programs in advancing health informatics as a field. As you begin to conduct research, explore (and cite in your discussion) an early journal article or excerpt from a seminal book on the topic of health informatics. If applicable, how has informatics evolved since then?

<strong>Topic 2:</strong> The Use of Information Systems in the Delivery of Healthcare

Identify stakeholders that would be involved in the selection of a health IT system. After establishing this list, make a subsection list of the goals and interests of each group: Are they primarily clinical? Financial? Operational?

<strong>Topic 3:</strong> ePatient, Social Networking, and Personal Health Record

Although health IT governance is a relatively “new” concept, the demands for this expertise are vast and the needs are immediate. Healthcare reform is one example. How is health IT governance being used to ensure that the requirements of the Affordable Care Act are being met, implemented, monitored, and maintained?

<strong>Topic 4:</strong> Selection, Implementation, and Delivery

A major obstacle to the global adoption, expansion, and progress of eHealth is the lack of available healthcare workers trained in informatics and adequately prepared to work in this growing field. What unique skill set(s) are needed to work in this evolving discipline? What obstacles present themselves as informatics expands globally (e.g., education/language barriers, differences in terminology, legal issues, access to technology, regulatory policies, etc.)? How might these challenges be overcome?
